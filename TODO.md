* Handle switching audio inputs while recording
* Handle other audio formats nicely (ie by doing nothing)
* Do mirroring in video
* Unittests for conservative trigger
* Previews for UI components

## Manual testing operations

Should be done before major releases

* Switching between windows chosen by picker, shared AV devices, history options
* Closing windows which appear in the history menu
* recording video
	* stopping manually
	* quitting the app to stop recording
* Probably buggy:
	* Close the mirror window while recording
	* switching audio devices while debugging
